## Introduction

Describing the topology of networks of seed circulation is interesting since it gives insight on how exchanges are organized within a PPB programme or a Community Seed Bank[@bioversity_csb_2015][@pautasso_seed_2013]. 
Analysis can be done at several geographical or organizing scales, for example local, regional or national.

Two types of network are handled within `PPBstats` :

- unipart network where nodes are:
    - seed lots (i.e. a combinaison of a germplasm in a given location a given year) and edges are relationships such as diffusion, mixture, reproduction, crosses or selection for example.
    - locations and edges are diffusion events between locations

- bipart network where nodes are either location or germplasm


### Workflow and function relations in `PPBstats` regarding network analysis

The workflow is very simple as only descriptive analysis can be done based on network format (Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-Study-network-of-seed-circulation)).

```{r decision-tree-Study-network-of-seed-circulation, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Decision tree with objectives and analysis carry out in `PPBstats` regarding network analysis. **M** refers to methods."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree_Study-network-of-seed-circulation.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:main-workflow-network) displays the functions and their relationships.
Table \@ref(tab:function-descriptions-workflow-network) describes each of the functions.

You can have more information for each function by typing `?function_name` in your R session.

```{r main-workflow-network, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Main functions used in the workflow."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/main-functions-network.png")
```
